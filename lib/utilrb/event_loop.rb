module Utilrb
    # Simple event loop which supports timers and defers blocking operations to
    # a thread pool those results are queued and being processed by the event
    # loop thread at the end of each step. 
    #
    # All events must be code blocks which will be executed at the end of each step.
    # There is no support for filtering or event propagations.
    #
    # For an easy integration of ruby classes into the event loop the {Forwardable#def_event_loop_delegator}
    # can be used.
    #
    # @example Example for using the EventLoop
    #   event_loop = EventLoop.new 
    #   event_loop.once do 
    #     puts "called once"
    #   end
    #
    #   event_loop.every(1.0) do 
    #     puts "called every second"

    #   callback = Proc.new |result|

    #   event_loop.defer callback do
